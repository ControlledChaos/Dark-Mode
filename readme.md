# Dark Mode

Lets your users make the WordPress admin dashboard darker.

## Contribute

If you would like to make WordPress more visually appealing in the dark, please contribute! Styling the entirety of the admin dashboard is a huge task we need people on hand to do it!

Ideally, Dark Mode will one day be a part of the WordPress Core. Until then, we need people to help design, build and test this feature to ensure it's up the standard of being included. Please submit pull requests with details of your changes into this repository for consideration.

## Installation & Setup

It's really easy to get started with contributing to the Dark Mode plugin. You'll need to make sure you're using a fairly recent version of Sass - the CSS preprocessor - of at least version 4.0 or above.

Pull down the repository and then `cd` into the plugin package. From there, run the following command to start auto compiling your CSS changes.

```
sass --watch darkmode.scss:darkmode.css --style compressed
```

When you're done, push your changes back up to GitHub and submit a Pull Request with your changes.
